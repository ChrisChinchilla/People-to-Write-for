# Who are awesome people to write for?

As a professional technical blogger and writer I am frequently asked who is reliable and good to write for? I get asked the question so much it felt like a good time to start collating a list of people I have worked with, along with my experiences and also invite you to add your suggestions and experiences.

## Standards and Company Secrecy

I would like to make this repository as informative and useful as possible, but I don't intend it to be offensive or reveal sensitive information. Please only include outlets you actually have experience working for.

### Money

Instead of mentioning exact pay rates, note whether they are **0**, **low**, **good**, or **high**.

A rough estimate of this, per article is:

-   0 = 0
-   0 - 75 = Low
-   75 - 200 = Good
-   200+ = High

### Language

Sure, some people are a pain to work for, but be constructive with your comments and don't just use this as a forum to air your grievances.

## Journalism, Tutorial, Opinion?

"Tech blogging" is a broad field and can mean anything from writing a tutorial, to an opinion piece, to interviews, to a list of consumer apps, and everything in-between. In the description of each outlet, give a rough indication of where they fit.

In this section include blogs aimed at developers and include some form of technical content, maybe a tutorial, guide, or in-depth technical analysis of a subject.

> Easy to work for, articles are well shared in relevant communities, there are writer perks such as conference tickets, the blog is well respected and if they like you, will offer a regular payment schedule. It's not advertising supported, so they focus more on quality than speed and frequency.

### Dzone

#### Topics

Broad coverage of development topics, but with heavy Java content, working hard to push into new topics and channels.

Low - Good, depending on how you write for them.

#### Experience

> I work for DZone as a 'Zone Leader', creating roughly two posts a week, largely on any topic that fits into any of their categories. I also have some other targets and responsibilities, but the editorial team are fairly relaxed about these targets.

### SitePoint

#### Topics

Broad coverage of development, design and the business ideas behind them. From my experiences, the JavaScript and PHP channels have the best traffic.

#### Pay Rate

Medium, and depends on the content type you write.

#### Experience

> As with any advertising supported site, they are fussier about content, what it covers and how it is structured. SitePoint can occasionally accept pitches and then not publish them, meaning you put in the effort and receive no pay for it. Their peer-review process is also an amazing idea but can mean that it takes a long time between submissions and publishing, and they pay you when an article is published. That aside, SitePoint is a massively popular site, is well known in the developer community and popular articles will garner you a lot of publicity. As well as an article contributor to SitePoint, I have written a book for them and was a channel editor for two years, so I have seen all sides of the process.

### Tech Beacon

Broad coverage of development, DevOps, QA and security.

#### Pay Rate

High

> You have strong contact with your editor who will guide you through ideas, building a pitch, and the editing process. This can mean a reasonable amount of work before they accept your pitch, but good preparation always helps in the long run anyway. I wrote three articles for the outlet and then heard nothing and wasn't sure what happened.

### Cult of Mac

### The Next Web

0 to ?, depending on channel.

#### Experience

> I have only ever contributed articles to the unpaying 'contributors' section, with no indication of when this may change. However after an initial trial period I can mostly publish what I want, when I want and the articles get good exposure.
