# Who are good sites to write for?

As a professional technical blogger and writer I am frequently asked who is reliable and good to write for? I get asked the quesiton so much it was a good time to start collating a list of peeople I have worked with and also invite you to add your suggestions and experiences.

I would like to make this repository as informative and useful as possible, but let's not cause offence or reveal sensitive information. For example, instead of mentioning exact pay rates, note wether they are 0, low, good, or high.

A rough estimate of this might be:

- 0 = 0
- 0 - 75 = Low
- 75 - 200 = Good
- 200+ = High
