#### Pay Rate

High

#### Experience

Easy to work for, articles are well shared in relevant communities, there are writer perks such as conference tickets, the blog is well respected and if they like you, will offer a regular payment schedule. It's not advertising supported, so they focus more on quality than speed and frequency.

### SitePoint

#### Topics

Broad coverage of development, design and the business ideas behind them. From my experiences, the JavaScript and PHP channels have the best traffic.

#### Pay Rate

Medium, and depends on the content type you write.

#### Experience

As with any advertising supported site, they are fussier about content, what it covers and how it is structured. SitePoint can occasionally accept pitches and then not publish them, meaning you put in the effort and receive no pay for it. Their peer-review process is also an amazing idea but can mean that it takes a long time between submissions and publishing, and they pay you when an article is published.

That aside, SitePoint is a massively popular site, is well known in the developer community and popular articles will garner you a lot of publicity.

As well as an article contributor to SitePoint, I have written a book for them and was a channel editor for two years, so I have seen all sides of the process.

### Sqreen

### Tech Beacon

#### Topics

Broad coverage of development, DevOps, QA and security.

#### Pay Rate

High

#### Experience

This is a newer outlet for me, so I am still yet to complete my opinions. But so far my main experience has been that you have strong contact with your editor who will guide you through ideas, building a pitch, and the editing process. This can mean a reasonable amount of work before they accept your pitch, but good preparation always helps in the long run anyway.
